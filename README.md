        3. Network

# COMPUTATION 


## CPU - CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (also known as a processor).

CPU is reffered to as the brain of the computer and is the most important component of the computer . The fundamental steps or sequence of steps which he Cpu performs are known as the fetch executive cycle or instruction cycle.
STEPS ARE- 1. FETCH 2. DECODE THE INSTRUCTION 3. EXECUTE 4. STORE THE RESULTS

PARTS OF CPU -
ARITHEMATIC LOGIC UNIT (ALU) - Performs all mathematical and arithematic operations.
1. data transfer 2. Arithematic operation 3. Decision making

CONTOLLING UNIT (CU) - It is in- charge of fetch execution cycle. It extracts the instructions from memory and decodes and excutes them calling on the ALU, when neccessary.

REGISTERS - Small and fast storage area inside computers. It is used to immediate calcualtions or instuctions that are needed immediately.


## DPU → Data Processing Unit
 It manages data movement, networking, and storage tasks so the CPU can focus on running programs. It manages data movement, networking, and storage tasks so the CPU can focus on running programs.
 
 ### Purpose

Offloads data-heavy tasks from the CPU (like network packet handling, encryption, compression, etc.). Improves speed for cloud computing, AI, and data centers.

### where is it used ?

NVIDIA BlueField DPU

Intel Infrastructure Processing Unit (IPU — similar concept)

## GPU - Graphics processing unit

A GPU is a special chip in your computer that is really good at doing many small calculations at the same time.

It was originally made for drawing graphics (images, videos, games), but now it’s also used for AI, machine learning, and data processing because of its parallel processing power.

### Purpose

Render images and videos.

Speed up tasks that need massive parallel calculations (AI, simulations, crypto mining).

### Where it’s used

Gaming computers & consoles

AI/ML model training

3D rendering & animation

Data science and deep learning

### Examples

NVIDIA GeForce RTX series (gaming)

NVIDIA Tesla / A100 / H100 (AI & data centers)

AMD Radeon RX series

## TPU - Tensor processing unit 

A TPU is a special chip made by Google that’s designed only to make AI and Machine Learning (especially deep learning) work super fast.

### Purpose

Speed up AI/ML model training and inference.

Optimized for tensor math used in neural networks.

### Where it’s used

Google Cloud servers

AI research (Google Translate, Google Photos, etc.)

Large-scale deep learning projects

# OPERATING SYSTEM 

An operating system is an interface between the user and the computer hardware. It manages computer resources and enables effective operation of hardware by users and applications.



# STORAGE 

### PRIMARY STORAGE 

Primary storage also known as main memory storage.

Examples: RAM (Random Access Memory), Cache memory.

Key Points:

Fast access speed.

Volatile (data is lost when power is off).

Directly accessed by the CPU.

### Secondary Storage 

##### Meaning: 

Permanent storage used to keep data and programs for long-term use.

##### Examples:

Hard Disk Drive (HDD), Solid State Drive (SSD), CD/DVD, Pen drives.

##### Key Points:

Slower than primary storage.

Non-volatile (data remains even when power is off).

Used for storing files, applications, and the operating system.
