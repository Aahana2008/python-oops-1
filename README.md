It controls CPU, memory, devices, and programs so they work together smoothly.

Without the kernel, the operating system cannot function.

### IP ADDRESS

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique string of numbers separated by periods or colons that identifies each device connected to a network. IP addresses serve two primary functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network. They are essential for routing internet traffic and ensuring data reaches the correct destination.

### Port No. 

It is a number assigned to a specific process or service on a computer to help send and receive data over a network. a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. ‚Ä¢ [for http - 80 ‚Ä¢ SSH(Secure Shell) - 22 ‚Ä¢ SMTP - 25 ‚Ä¢ Telnet - 23 ‚Ä¢ https - 443 ‚Ä¢ DNS - 53

### SSL( Secure Socket Layer )

It is a security technology that protects the data sent between a user‚Äôs browser and a website.

SSL encrypts information so hackers cannot read it while it travels over the internet. You can see it as the lock icon (üîí) in your browser address bar when visiting a secure website.

# FRONTEND,BACKEND AND API(Application Programming Interface)
In web development, the terms frontend, backend, and API refer to different aspects of building and managing applications. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each:

### 1.Frontend
Frontend refers to the client-side of a web application. It encompasses everything that users interact with directly in their web browsers. This includes:

### 2.Backend
Backend refers to the server-side of a web application. It involves everything that happens on the server and is responsible for managing and processing data. Key aspects include:

### 3.API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs can be used to connect Frontend and Backend

#### Together, these components work to create a complete web application, with the frontend providing the user experience, the backend managing data and logic, and the API facilitating communication between the two.

# The 7 layers of OSI model:-
### :-Layer 7 : (Application Layer) - The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients.

### :-Layer 6 : (Presentation Layer )- The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compresses data so it is received correctly on the other end.

### :-Layer 5 : (Session Layer )- The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices.

### :-Layer 4 : (Transport Layer )- The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into ‚Äúsegments‚Äù on the transmitting end.

### :-Layer 3 : ((Networking Layer) - The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end.

### :-Layer 2 : (Data-Link-Layer) - The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network.

### :-Layer 1 :( Physical Layer) - The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes.

# Hypervisor :-
A hypervisor is a software layer that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on the same physical machine. It's also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM)
